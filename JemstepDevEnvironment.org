* How do you create a great environment for developers?

 5 things we are learning along the Jemstep journey

* Introduction
In 2016 a small South African startup with 18 employees in total was acquired by Invesco,
an investment management company with $970 billion Assets Under Management.

#+REVEAL: split

Two years later, and Jemstep has grown from a team of 18 people to about 90, spread across 4 continents.

* Where we came from (2016)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - About 100,000 lines of  Scala code
  - About 60,000 lines of JavaScript/CSS/HTML
  - Automated build pipelines, with automated deployments
  - Automated deployments about once per day, triggered by QA
  - 18 people: 5 developers, 2 testers, some investment specialists, product
    managers, customer support

* What we are learning about our Developer Experience
 
* 1. Unproductive time multiplies as teams grow

** We created a dedicated “Developer Productivity” squad


* 2. Developer onboarding needs to be excellent

Fast, reproducible and stable.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Lots of new developers joining our Sandton office
  - Remote locations: Argentina, Peru, India

** Onboarding experience in 2014

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Figure out what to download and install
  - Figure out why something works on all other machines except yours
  - Ask for random pieces of installation instructions as you hit errors
  - Copy some required files from colleagues when you discover you need it
  - Onboarding time: YMMV. Maybe 2 weeks.

** We dockerized the developer environment

From 2015 our onboarding time went down from about 2 weeks to about 3 days.

** Still not good enough

Containers are great, but there are still a lot of setup on the host that had to
be done manually.

** We created our own Linux build

USB stick in, Linux distro out.

** We fully automated the developer environment setup

Ansible FTW

** Onboarding experience in 2017

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Log in to a pre-installed custom Linux distro
  - Run the developer setup ansible scripts
  - Type in a password or so here and there
  - Wait for some downloads to finish
  - Deploy to production
  - Onboarding time: less than a day

* Thing 3

“Build a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he'll
be warm for the rest of his life.”


* Thing 4

Laurie got offended that I used the word “puke.”
But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like.

* Thing 5

When I die, I want to die peacefully, in my sleep, like my grandpa did. Not like
the screaming passengers in his car.

* What we struggle with

* What we are focusing on now

* Where to next?

* Summary
