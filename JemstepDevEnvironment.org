* How do you create a great environment for developers?

 5 things we learned along the Jemstep journey

* Introduction

In 2016 a small South African startup with 18 employees in total was acquired by Invesco,
an investment management company with $970 billion Assets Under Management.

Two years later, and Jemstep has grown from a team of 18 people to about 90, spread across 4 continents.

Along the way we created a squad to focus solely on “Developer Productivity”.

This is what we are learning. We hope some of it may be useful in your teams as well.

* Thing 1

If you really want to impress people, add the words “blockchain” to the end of
everything you say, blockchain.

* Thing 2

Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes. That way you are a
mile away from them and you have their shoes.


* Thing 3

“Build a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he'll
be warm for the rest of his life.”


* Thing 4

Laurie got offended that I used the word “puke.”
But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like.

* Thing 5

When I die, I want to die peacefully, in my sleep, like my grandpa did. Not like
the screaming passengers in his car.
